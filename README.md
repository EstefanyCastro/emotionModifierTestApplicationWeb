# Emotional virtual pet

This project is an Angular web application that simulates a virtual emotional dog. The application is based on an emotional management toolkit that allows you to interact with the dog and observe how its emotions change in response to different interactions.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive tool to study and manage emotions through a virtual pet model. The virtual dog responds to various user actions, and these responses are managed by the developed emotional toolkit, which you can review at the following link:
